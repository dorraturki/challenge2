                Blake Suárez is an illustrator and designer with a fantastic sense of humor.
                His quirkiness comes through thanks to his humorous tone and goofy picture.
                The page, while minimalist in design, offers a glimpse into Suárez’s colorful personality and his impressive block of work.
